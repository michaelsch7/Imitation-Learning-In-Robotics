# Imitation Learning in Metaworld 

This project shows imitation learning being used in the Metaworld enviroment to train and test an intelligent robotic agent. The agent runs in the SawyerPickPlaceV2 enviroment and completes a task to pick up and object and move it to another specified location. A convolutional neural network is used to observe each state and the weights for this model is in /Models
